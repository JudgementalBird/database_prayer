Little one-off thing I made to inspect a database I have. Was unsure about the length, format, and validity of the data in it, so this assumes a BLOB field on the database is deserializable into Vec\<u32\>, and prints it pretty in the console.
This is probably not useful for anyone, and probably not written well at all, I am mostly putting it on github as a backup.

I am aware the database is included, it is there because I do not have a reason to hide the contents.
